/*
 * This class is used to provide a flat structure of the CS_Part__c and its associated Part_Prices__r, Part_Materials__r 
 * and Part_Skills__r. This is to avoid storing unnecessary information in the JSON string, but also avoiding the
 * deserialization issues since metadata generated by SF that describes the nested object types is lost when the structure
 * was passed from server to client, and then back for serialization and saving to an Attachment.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Needs to be kept in sync with the CS_PartWrapper Apex class (Property names & constructor parameters)
